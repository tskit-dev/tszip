# Installation

Tszip can be installed using the standard [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) distribution methods.

For pip users, run:

python3 -m pip install tszip
```

For conda users, tszip is distributed using the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel. To install, either ensure that conda-forge is listed in your default channels and run:

```{code-block} bash
conda install tszip
```

or explicitly install from conda-forge:

conda install -c conda-forge tszip
```
